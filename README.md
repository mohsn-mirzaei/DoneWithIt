# React Native Educational Project

This React Native application, developed using Expo, showcases the integration of cutting-edge packages. During its creation, I employed the latest versions of packages, deviating from the initial training codes due to their obsolescence.

The project was inspired by the comprehensive tutorial provided in [The Ultimate React Native Series](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-react-native-course), instructed by [Mosh Hamedani](https://github.com/mosh-hamedani). Throughout the tutorial, I gained proficiency in various aspects of React Native development:

- Building mobile apps with confidence
- Properly structuring React Native projects
- Efficiently running and debugging React Native apps
- Utilizing core components and APIs
- Constructing complex layouts with Flexbox
- Applying aesthetically pleasing styles to components
- Creating forms with Formik
- Implementing data validation with Yup
- Publishing React Native apps to Expo
- Applying industry best practices
- Writing clean and efficient code
- Using shortcuts for faster coding
- Accessing native device features
- Implementing navigation with React Navigation
- Adding visually appealing tabs
- Communicating with REST APIs
- Uploading images and monitoring progress with progress bars
- Building offline-capable apps
- Caching data and images
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Sending and receiving push notifications
- Logging and monitoring errors
- Managing configuration settings across different environments
- Building and distributing apps
